To do, maybe:

- Provide analysis?
- Add to Metaforecast in case no question is found

  - Requires one to transform query into a question, and then ask it
  - Shouldn't be too complicated.

- So actually, Open AI could also **extract the keywords** from a question!!
- Look at the squared / log distance between the predictions and all the questions on metaforecast.

You could also fine-tune a model on metaforecast predictions of more than 3 stars (maybe 2000-4000 of those)

- Fine tune model by crafting the loss function rather than na√Øvely.:
